                applications for mobile phones. To provide best user experience, The Apps Land need a few permissions.
                These permissions never use to access user data illegally. Neither our purpose is to collect data for
                misuse nor we collect data in any illegal way. We just need permissions for our applications to work
                fine for users. And the purpose is to provide best services and better user experience while using our
                apps.</p>

                regarding privacy and protection of our users data. Here are some details about what permissions we

                will use for cache, and such other uses. It will help our app to give best performance and results to
                you.</p>
